## Installation

1. Download and extract to your `resources` folder
2. Import `database_complete.sql` into your database
3. Add to `server.cfg`:
   ```cfg
   ensure n4-crafting
   ```
4. Add required items to `ox_inventory/data/items.lua`:
   ```lua
   ['crafting_bench'] = {
       label = 'Crafting Bench',
       weight = 5000,
       stack = false,
       close = true,
       description = 'A portable crafting workstation'
   },
   ```
5. Add blueprint items (example):

       description = 'Blueprint for crafting pistols'
   },
   ```

## Configuration

### Adding New Recipes

Edit `config/recipes.lua`:

```lua
['item_name'] = {
    label = 'Item Display Name',
    materials = { steel = 5, aluminum = 3 },
    time = 30000, -- milliseconds
    blueprint = 'blueprint_item_name',
    prop = 'prop_model_name', -- optional
    massCraft = true -- optional, for stackable items
}
```

Remember to add the blueprint item to both `ox_inventory/data/items.lua` and `config/blueprints.lua`.
