    - High speed driving increases wear rate significantly
    - Different surfaces (sand, rock) cause accelerated wear
    - Critical wear levels cause tire blowouts and reduced traction
  - **Battery System**: Realistic battery drain and electrical effects
    - Drains faster with damaged engine or during idle
    - Low battery causes dimmed lights and random engine shutdowns
    - Critical levels prevent vehicle startup
  - **Transmission/Gearbox**: Complex transmission wear simulation
    - High speed and body damage accelerate wear
    - Worn gearbox causes sluggish gear changes
    - Critical damage results in random gear shifts
  - **Collision Impact**: Vehicle collisions damage multiple components
    - Battery, gearbox, and tire wear increase with impact severity
    - Realistic damage distribution based on collision force

## Usage

### Shop Creation Process (Admin Only)

#### Starting Shop Creation
1. Use `/createshop` to start creating a new mechanic shop
2. Enable freecam mode automatically activates for precise placement
3. The system uses an interactive raycast-based point placement with visual markers

#### Zone Placement Steps
The creation process follows this specific order:

1. **Shop Name Input**
   - Enter a unique name for the mechanic shop
   - Names must be 3-50 characters long

2. **Management Zone**
   - Press `E` to place the management point
   - Visual marker shows exact placement location
   - This zone handles: employee management, shop settings, financial overview

3. **Parts Shop Zone**
   - Navigate to desired location and press `E`
   - Access point for purchasing parts and supplies
   - Inventory management and supplier orders

4. **Garage Zone**
   - Place the garage access point
   - Service vehicle storage and retrieval
   - Company vehicle management

5. **Lift Positions** (1-4 lifts per shop)
   - Place each lift position carefully
   - Consider vehicle access and workspace
   - Each lift operates independently

6. **Vehicle Spawn Points**
   - Set multiple spawn locations for serviced vehicles
   - Ensure clear path from lifts to spawn points
   - System automatically finds available spots

#### Visual Indicators During Creation
- **Green Marker**: Valid placement location
- **Red Marker**: Invalid or obstructed location
- **Yellow Circle**: Current zone radius
- **Blue Line**: Direction indicator for spawn points

### For Admins
1. Use `/createshop` to start creating a new mechanic shop
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to place zones. The system provides a raycast-based interface with visual markers to assist in placing zones accurately:
   - Management zone: For shop settings and employee management.
   - Parts Shop zone: For purchasing parts and supplies.
   - Garage zone: For storing and retrieving service vehicles.
   - Lift positions: Place up to 4 per shop for vehicle maintenance.
   - Vehicle spawn points: Designate spots for newly serviced vehicles to appear.

## Technical Implementation

### Point System (ox_lib)
The resource uses ox_lib's point system for zone management:

```lua
-- Example of management zone creation
local point = lib.points.new({
    coords = vec3(x, y, z),
    distance = 5,
    onEnter = function()
        -- Show interaction prompt
        lib.showTextUI('[E] - Access Management')
    end,
    onExit = function()
        -- Hide prompt
        lib.hideTextUI()
    end,
    nearby = function(self)
        -- Check for key press
        if IsControlJustPressed(0, 38) then -- E key
            openManagementMenu(shopId)
        end
    end
})
```

### Zone Types and Properties

### Shop Creation Workflow

```lua
-- Simplified creation flow
1. Admin command triggers server event
2. Server validates admin permissions
3. Client enters creation mode:
   - Enables freecam
   - Starts raycast loop
   - Shows placement markers
4. Each zone placement:
   - Raycast to ground
   - Validate position
   - Store coordinates
5. Final creation:
   - Send all data to server
   - Server creates database entry
   - Spawn zones for all players
```

### Data Storage Structure

  "zones": {
    "management": {
      "coords": {"x": 100.0, "y": 200.0, "z": 30.0},

      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Permissions

- Only admins can create shops and set mechanic jobs
- Only mechanics can access the mechanic menu
- Only shop owners can manage their shops
- Lift usage is restricted to one player at a time

## Fluid System Details

The fluid effects system provides realistic vehicle behavior:

### Degradation Factors
- **Base Rate**: 0.1% oil/coolant, 0.05% brake/steering per 30 seconds
- **Damaged Engine** (<900 health): 2x oil, 1.5x coolant degradation
- **High Speed** (>120 km/h): 1.5x oil, 2x coolant/brake degradation

### Performance Effects
- **Brake Fluid**: Directly modifies vehicle brake force
- **Engine Oil**: Causes engine damage (0.5 HP/s) and speed reduction
- **Coolant**: Increases engine temperature, auto-shutdown at 120°C
- **Power Steering**: Modifies steering lock angle

### Technical Features
- Caches original vehicle handling for proper restoration
- Uses Entity state bags for multiplayer synchronization
- Implements warning system to prevent notification spam
- Automatic memory cleanup every 10 minutes
- Server validation prevents cheating
